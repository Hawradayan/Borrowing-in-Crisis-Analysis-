### *Home Mortgage Disclosure Act — Florida, USA*

## **Overview**

This project analyzes six years of Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) data from Florida (2018–2023) to understand how borrower behavior and lending activity changed before, during, and after the COVID-19 shock.
The goal is to identify shifts in loan demand, approval patterns, refinancing trends, and borrower risk levels.

## **Key Insights**

### **1. Loan Activity & Interest Rates**

* Loan activity **peaked in 2020** and **dropped sharply in 2021**
* Average interest rates hit their **lowest levels** during the shock
  

### **2. Denial Rates**

* Denial rate **decreased by 3%** during the shock


### **3. Loan Purposes**

* Home purchase dominated in all periods
* Refinancing became the **second most common loan purpose** during the shock


### **4. Refinancing Behavior**

* Interest rates for refinancing hit their **minimum**


### **5. Borrower Financial Profile**

* Average annual income and average loan amount both **peaked during the shock**

* **80%** of applicants during the shock were **middle-income and above**, compared to **~70%** in **pre/post** periods
  

### **6. Risk Measures**

* Both **Loan-to-Income (LTI)** and **Loan-to-Value (LTV)** ratios were highest during the shock
  → Indicates **higher borrower risk**

* Interest rates decreased sharply in the shock period
* Despite low rates, **loan activity still dropped in 2021**

### **To Support Customer Demand**

* Offer refinancing products with reasonable LTV requirements
* Share clear information about interest-rate changes
* Introduce loyalty benefits for high-quality borrowers

## **Limitations**

* No credit score information
* No loan-performance tracking
* Annual (not monthly/quarterly) data granularity
* Not enough detail to compute additional advanced risk ratios

## ** Tools Used**
* **Python**: for data cleaning and preparation
* **PowerBi**: for creating visualizations and conducting the final analysis
